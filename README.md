HW due 6/30 (markdown file of the things you learned and you want to learn for this summer course)

## Day 1 (What did I learn today and what else would I want to learn)

I was very excited to begin this summer course and meet new people with similar interests as myself. 

Everyone introducing themselves opened my eyes to the wide variety of people with unqiue backgrounds that have signed up for this course.

Some things I'm excited to learn is the programming langauge "R" and how to apply this concept of Big Data and Machine Learning to real world applications. Learning all this information and being able to apply it is very helpful

HW due 6/30 (markdown file of the things you learned and you want to learn for this summer course)

# Day 1 (What did I learn today and what else would I want to learn)

Everyone introducing themselves opened my eyes to the wide variety of people with unqiue backgrounds that have signed up for this course.
